Web Consistency Testing ..... //TODO


Why "clementine"?
=================
Clementine is referencing a moon satellite (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clementine_(spacecraft)) from 1994.
It's primary goal was to test some new equipment technologies (new cameras etc.) and as they needed a subject to test this equipment on and since 1973, no probe has been to the moon, they decided to fly to the moon (short version XD ).

Actually, this project is very similar. Basically the goal is to create a library that allows the user to compare two sets of annotated DOM elements to find mismatches in the layout. So the comparison algorithm is like the new equipment. But of course someone has to provide the annotated DOM elements from real web pages and as - at least currently - selenium is some kind of state-of-the-art project to drive webbrowsers as it integrated with a lot of webdrivers and allows flexible infrastructures with the selenium grid. And as Selenium (the element) got it's name from the greek word for moon, the metaphor works out of the box. So this project is definitely not meant to be bound to selenium and I hope I'm able to seperate the dependencies well enough to make it independent of selenium, but the basic usage I can imagine right now is with selenium.

Why is everything missing here?
===============================
Because this project has just begone ;)
